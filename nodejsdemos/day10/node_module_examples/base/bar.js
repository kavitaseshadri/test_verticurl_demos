//how to import something from an external module
var foo = require('./foo');
foo();
//we are making using of the global require function
//the module is being imported using a certain name
//in this case the variable and the module's name are identical
//but this  is not a requirement
//besides, this module is only exporting 1 thing
//import the module without extension
